# Bug in netcat with IPv6 support.
# Scenerio: listen on IPv6, connect with IPv4
# The protocol stack stack passes the IPv4 connection to the IPv6
# server, but netcat can't do a forward host lookup on 0.0.0.0. This
# full DNS lookup is not optional. netcat barfs and no data is received.

nc -l6p 8000 &
echo "xxx" | nc localhost 8000

# 0.0.0.0: forward host lookup failed: Unknown host
