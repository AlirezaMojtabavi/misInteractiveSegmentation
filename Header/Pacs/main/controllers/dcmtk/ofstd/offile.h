/** this class provides a simple C++ encapsulation layer for stdio FILE pointers.
*  All stdio functions on files are directly mapped into member functions.
*  The handling of large files (64 bit file systems) is transparent. Instead
*  of type off_t, fseek() and ftell() use offile_off_t which is a 64 bit type
*  if available on the underlying platform. Similarly, getpos() and setpos() use
*  type offile_fpos_t, which is defined appropriately.
*  This class provides both of_fclose() and of_pclose(), but these are equivalent -
*  the code always closes pipes with pclose() and files with of_fclose().
*  Finally, an abstraction for errno is provided. Error codes should always
*  be retrieves using methods getLastError() and getLastErrorString() which
*  on Unix platforms are based on errno and strerror/strerror_r, but may be based
*  on other mechanisms on platforms where errno does not exist.
