/**
 * @c Serializable declares the interface for user defined data types
 * which should allow (de-)serialization.
 *
 * @par
 * Just realize the @c Serializable interface in your user defined
 * class to make it (de-)serializable using @c XmlSerializer and @c XmlDeserializer.
 *
 * @par
 * Here is a short example of realizing the @c Serializable interface
 * to make a class (de-)serializable:
 * @code
 * class Data : public Serializable {
 * private:
 *     int i_;
 *
 * public:
 *     virtual void serialize(XmlSerializer& s) const {
 *         s.serialize("i", i_);
 *     }
 *
 *     virtual void deserialize(XmlDeserializer& s) {
 *         s.deserialize("i", i_);
 *     }
 * };
 * @endcode
 * For more complex examples and interaction with other classes of the serialization framework
 * see the &quot;serializertest&quot; application in &quot;apps/&quot; directory.
 *
 * @note You have to implement a default constructor for each class which is used as a pointer
 *       for serialization. Moreover, you have to make it available to the @c XmlDeserializer class
 *       and to all factories which needs a default constructor using a @c friend statement.
 *
 * @attention You have to ensure that @c Serializable respectively @c AbstractSerializable
 *            is the first class from which you derive. Otherwise there will be pointer
 *            mismatches due to type conversions.
 *
 * @attention Do not use global respectively static variables in the @c serialize
 *            and @c deserialize method, since this can lead to difficult bugs.
 *            Furthermore, you may expect that @c serialize and @c deserialize
 *            methods are executed sequentially, but some of them need a delayed execution.
 *
 * @attention If you want to make an abstract class serializable, please realize
 *            @c AbstractSerializable instead of @c Serializable as it prevents trying to
 *            make instances using the default constructor.
 *
 * @see AbstractSerializable
 * @see XmlSerializer
 * @see XmlDeserializer
