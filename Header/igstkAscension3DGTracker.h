	* This class provides an interface to Ascension Technology 
	* Corporation's 3D Guidance family of magnetic trackers.
	*
	* Events are provided that can be used to monitor the status of
	* the tracker. These include notifications when sensors are attached
	* or detached, when a sensor is too close or too far away from the
	* magnetic transmitter, and if the magnetic transmitter is unplugged.
	* At startup the state of the system can be querried with the Request
	* methods. After the initial state is learned, changes can be monitored
	* by setting up an observer for Ascension3DGToolEvent events.
