/**
 * Class for managing files for cache entries and storing/loading a database-like
 * representation into/from a XML-file 'cacheindex.xml'.
 * The underlying data of the cache entries are the names of the files where
 * the cached data can be found on hard-disk, associated with <i>keys</i>.
 * An object in the cache is associated
 * with a <i>key</i> which consists of the concatenation of a <i>top-level key</i>
 * and a <i>sub-level key</i>, separated by a dot ("."). The cached data are written
 * to disk by the <code>Cache<T></code> class,
 * but the file name is mapped to that key by <code>CacheIndex</code>.
 * Besides, CacheIndex checks the existence of the directory the cache uses,
 * and creates it if necessary.
 * CacheIndex is designed using the singleton design pattern, i.e. that there
 * is only one CacheIndex, managing all cached objects. Destinctions between
 * different kinds of object may be made by the key,
 *
 * The <code>CacheIndex</code> has a two-level hierarchy: it holds 0..*
 * <code>CacheIndexEntry</code> objects, which on their parts consist of a
 * top-level key and may contain 0..* objects of the
 * <code>CacheIndexSubEntry</code> class.
 * <code>CacheIndexSubEntry</code> objects hold one <i>sub-level key</i>
 * (<i>sub-keys</i>) each and the actual file name for the cached data.
